An xna pipeline for reading the steam hammer engine vmf files

The Hammer editor is a component of the Stream SDK, it is used for generating maps for the various half-life/portal
games. It provides an ideal platform for creating levels in other games as well.  This project is an attempt to do
just that by providing a generic framework for importing the hammer vmf files that are used for level definitions.
